        <h2>2. General Information on Data Processing</h2>
        <p>We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only with the user's consent. An exception applies in cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>
        <p>Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art. 6(1)(a) EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.</p>
        <p>For the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual measures.</p>
        <p>Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
        <p>In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
        <p>If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Erasure and Storage Duration</h2>
        <p>The personal data of the data subject are erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Storage may also take place if provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. Blocking or erasure of the data also takes place when a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.</p>

        <h2>5. Provision of the Website and Creation of Log Files</h2>
        <p>Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. The following data is collected:</p>

            <li>Websites from which the user's system accesses our website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to the user's computer. For this, the user's IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session. Storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>
